# Welcome to 
# The Lessons from Rust for C++ Developers

Hello my name is Erdem and I'm a C++ Developer (Believe me I _double_ checked).

Everything on this presentation including these slides & code examples can be found at my github. 

[my github](http://github.com/erdemu)

## Agenda for today

1. What is Rust ? Why should I care about it ?

2. What is this meeting ? What should I expect ?

3. Cargo ( Package manager )

4. Testing but built-in

5. Code generation you love but built-in

6. Linear types

7. Concept of Lifetimes

## What is Rust ?

/>
<Steps>
    <li>A sort of new (developed in 2010s) systems programming language.</li>
    <li>Developed by mozilla</li>
    <li>It has been voted 4 consequtive times as the most loved language of the year</li>
    <li>Main focus is on safety and multithreaded systems programming</li>
    <li>It has been designed to mitigate pain points in older system programming languages</li>
    <li>Used by mozilla, microsoft, dropbox on low level systems</li>
    <li>It's compiler is backed by LLVM so has many targets (Yes including embedded microcontrollers) </li>
</Steps>

---

## Why you should care about the Rust ?

<Steps>
    <li>C/C++ are really really cool languages. That's why they are still here</li>
    <li>But they desingned in a different era</li>
    <li>We are not programming like when we were back then</li>
    <li>It has been desinged with current facilities in mind.</li>
    <li>Same facilities and values as C++ (Only pay for what you use etc.)</li>
    <li>It has been desinged by people like us to relieve some pain</li>
    <li>Simple bugs cost much</li>
</Steps>

---

## What is this meeting ? What should I expect ?

<Steps>
    <li>Okay okay, I am admitting that I am a bit of in love with this language.</li>
    <li>... and maybe a bit of envy of its features</li>
    <li>This meeting is about some features in rust that I personally think very good</li>
    <li>And I want to show them to you and maybe try to do something similiar in modern C++.</li>
    <li>If you are interested in Rust and thinking this is a Rust 101 i'm sorry but this is not it.</li>
    <li>But I hope there are still much quality content here, so don't leave yet</li>
</Steps>

# I am envy of Cargo 
# ( Their package manager )

---

## I am envy of Cargo ( Their package manager )

<Steps>
    <li>Remember when I said there are features designed for our current way of programming</li>
    <li>Package managers are little programs that can download and install libraries developed by someone else for you</li>
    <li>We don't have anything like that (as a strandard) in C++</li>
    <li>With Cargo you can do some interesting (non-centralised) stuff</li>
</Steps>

## I am envy of Cargo ( Their package manager )

<Steps>
    <li>These are all very good but how we can achieve something similiar in C++ ?</li>
    <li>For the reminder of this section I will try to create same thing with using Cmake</li>
    <li>Rationale : Cmake is the best thing we have in C/C++ to name as a standard </li>
    <li>Cmake is a rich language/meta build system. We can achieve this easily by writing our own cmake scripts</li>
    <li>Ideally we really don't want to write custom scripts</li>
    <li>Who needs more stuff to maintain ?</li>
    <li>Luckly Cmake world is good enough to fulfill our desires</li>
</Steps>

## The End

Got any questions ?
